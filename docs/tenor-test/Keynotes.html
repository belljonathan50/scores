					<h2>Craig Vear</h2> <img src="img/craig-vear.jpeg" align="right" style="vertical-align:middle;margin:0px 5px">
					
					
					Craig Vear is Professor of Digital Performance and Music at De Montfort University, UK, where he was recently awarded a				
					<a href="https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101002086">European Research Council project</a>.  Drawing on findings from over a decade’s worth of practice-based experimentation in the field, the author builds a framework for understanding how digital scores create meaning. This book provides a solid foundation for any student/artist/teacher wishing to explore the relationship between notation and technology.

					In the author's own words:

				   <i>
				   Digital technology is transforming the musical score as a broad array of innovative score systems have become available to musicians. From the mediation of printed page, to animated and graphical scores, to artificial intelligence-based options, digital scoring affects the musical process by opening up new possibilities for dynamic interaction between the performer and the music, changing how we understand the boundaries between composition, score, improvisation and performance. The Digital Score: Musicianship, Creativity and Innovation offers a guide into this new landscape, reflecting on what these changes mean for music-making from both theoretical and applied perspectives.

	<h2>Sandeep Bhagwati</h2>
	<img src="img/sandeep.jpeg" align="right" width="250" height="260" style="vertical-align:middle;margin:0px 5px">
	
	Sandeep Bhagwati is a a composer, researcher, poet, theatre maker, installation artist, and conductor, born in India, a citizen of Germany now living in Montréal, Canada.
	In his work, he likes to ask himself questions that he cannot answer, set himself tasks that stymie him, and to break with practices that no one thinks are broken. In order to further foster and enhance his ignorance, he founded, in 2006, a research-creation lab at Concordia University, the matralab, where he and his team work on computer-improvisation, interactive scores, invisible bodysuit scores and creative research into inter-traditional music and theater forms, but also on the theoretical-artistic exploration of comprovisational technique, inter-traditional aesthetics and world-conscious art practices such as political performance, environmental sound art or responsive creation.
